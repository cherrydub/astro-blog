        kickstart my career in web development. I recently made the exciting
        transition from the IT field, and now I'm eagerly seeking my first role
        as a web developer.
	</p>
	<p><i class="las la-globe-europe"></i> I'm open to opportunities that offer
        flexibility, whether it's in-office, a hybrid setup, or the chance to
        work remotely across Europe. What drives me is the desire to find a role
        that nurtures continuous learning and allows me to excel as a Software
        Engineer.</p>
		<p><i class="las la-route"></i> My journey into web development has been an
			incredible one. Fresh out of an intensive coding bootcamp, coupled with
			a background in IT and a relentless drive for self-improvement, I'm
			well-prepared to step into the world as a Junior Developer.</p>
        <p><i class="lab la-dev"></i> My development approach is deeply rooted in
			best practices, from collaborative problem-solving through
			pair-programming to meticulous version control. I'm well-versed in
			diverse programming paradigms, a strong advocate of the DRY principle,
			an implementer of SOLID design patterns, and a proficient manager of
			CRUD operations.</p>
        <p><i class="lab la-connectdevelop"></i> My strength lies in adaptability,
			proactiveness, and an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement. I
			thrive in collaborative environments and relish the opportunity to
			contribute to innovative projects.</p>
